Hello! 

Thank you for checking in with my final project. This is for the HarvardX PH125.9x Data Science: Capstone - Choose Your Own Final Project. This has been 
an exciting past 8 months for me going through this course. I've been a data geek for a few years now with Excel and have been able to build robust
spreadsheet automation systems for my company. They encouraged me to take this class to learn a new data science language to see if that could help
the company further. I must admit, during several of the 9 courses in this course series, I did not know how I could apply it to my company. 
I was having a difficult time seeing how casino-based betting games could apply to analyzing real estate transactions.
However, as I progressed in the course series, I saw how regression and machine learning models could help us predict sale prices of homes, and I was
eager to work a final project on this topic. After I completed the first final project using the course-provided dataset of movie ratings, which was a useful
and informative exercise, I looked on the course-suggested website Kaggle.com to look for a cleaned dataset that contained real estate transaction data.
I eventually found this dataset from the URL https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/derrekdevon/real-estate-sales-2001-2020?resource=download. The user who
scraped this data is username: derrekdevon. The data set was well over 900,000 rows, and roughly 95MB. Even zipped, it was over 25MB. In order to 
upload to Github, I had to reduce the compressed file size to under 25MB, so I deleted roughly 373,000 rows of data that had the Property Type of NaN.
After zipping the "reduced" dataset, it was 17.7MB, which was able to be uploaded to Github. This did alter some of the graphs because it deleted most of the
real estate transactions that occurred before 2007. 

Besides that, I'm really happy with what I learned from this course, and I loved doing these final projects because it felt less scripted, more like
it would if I was working at my comopany trying to analyze things free style. Don't get me wrong, the course modules were excellent and took me from knowing 
nothing about R to being able to perform a full-blown data analysis project on a real-world dataset that is applicable to my job. However, actually
doing these final projects has helped me to feel significantly stronger in my knowledge and foundation in R. I'm excited to take what I learned and
apply it to the data at my work and see what value I can provide to my company. We're looking at expanding our lending into new markets in new parts
of the country, and real estate markets absolutely vary from city to city, metro to metro, state to state, and sometimes even street to street.
I want to analyze different parts of the country and see if there are any good markets our company should get into. I am a complete data geek
and am geeking out even thinking about doing this. 

Anyways, I digress. I hope you can learn a little about the nation-wide real estate market from 2001-2020. 

Thank you for taking the time to look at my project.
